### SECTION 1  - Introduction & Setup ###

### Getting Ready ###

+ Re-watch promo if not seen recently
+ You’ll need to be familiar with Blender’s interface, Python or programming, the console / terminal 
+ An overview of the course 
+ How to ask good questions.

### Blender Python Console ###

+ Install Blender 2.78 or above
+ Add a Python Console editor and explore 
+ Expand your Info editor to see UI logs 
+ Hover to discover Python commands 
+ Tab and Shift-Tab to indent or un-indent

### PC - Replacing Bundled Python ###

+ Windows does **not** come bundled with Python
+ Blender 2.78 for PC is bundled with Python 3.5.1 
+ We are replacing bundled version to… 
+ Understand how Blender uses Python on PC 
+ Get a copy of PIP so we can install Pillow later.

### Mac - Replacing Bundled Python ###

+ MacOS 10 is bundled with Python 2.6 & 2.7
+ Blender 2.78 for Mac bundled with Python 3.5.1 
+ We are replacing bundled version to… 
+ Understand how Blender uses Python on Mac 
+ Get a copy of PIP so we can install Pillow later.

### Pillow - Python Image Library ###

+ Pillow is a Python Image Library (PIL) fork
+ Pillow will allow us to render text to an image 
+ On PC use: **pip install pillow**
+ On Mac use: **sudo pip3 install pillow**
+ Check that Blender has access to Pillow.

### External Text Editor (Atom) ###

+ Choose and setup a Python editor
+ We choose Atom, stick with what you know 
+ Install the autocomplete-python add-on 
+ Check syntax highlighting is working 
+ Write our first script outside Blender, and run it.

### Running Python Code in Blender ###

+ Using sys.path.append to get access to code
+ Using **importlib** to make module reloading easy 
+ Where to find your console output 
+ Quick “Hello World” test 
+ Manipulating our first Blender object.

### How To Reload Python Code ###

+ By default your code won’t update
+ We can use **importlib** to fix this 
+ Test full-circle rapid development of Python.

### Section 1 Wrap-Up ###

+ You’ve learnt a lot
+ Incidental complexity, but really important 
+ Share your setup ideas with the community 
+ Dive STRAIGHT into next section while fresh.
